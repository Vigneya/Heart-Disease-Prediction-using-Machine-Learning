# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Overview
This project aims to predict whether a person has heart disease based on various medical parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc. By using different machine learning algorithms, the project attempts to provide an accurate diagnosis, which could assist healthcare providers in early detection of heart diseases.

Project Description
The goal of this project is to classify patients into two categories:

0: No heart disease
1: Heart disease present
This classification is based on features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and more. The models used in this project range from simple algorithms like logistic regression to more complex ensemble methods like random forests.
